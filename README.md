# Sitemap Extractor 5000

This is my training module for extracting links from site's sitemaps

Very useful in SEO, if you know what I mean. This is just for learning purposes.
So, this little ( ~100 lines of code) script takes any domain and returns links from it's sitemap xml-structure. It goes as deep as it need.
Feel free to write a codereview :)
